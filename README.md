# credit-risk-classification
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


# QUESTION: HOW WELL DOES THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL PREDICT BOTH THE 0 AND 1 LABELS?
# ANSWER: 
HEALTHY LOAN PRECISION IS 1.00, BEING IT PREDICTS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. HIGH-RISK LOAN IS ALSO HIGH AT .87, BUT THERE IS A FAIR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. 
THE F1 SCORE IS THE MEAN OF PRECISION AND RECALL AND FOR BOTH ARE VERY HIGH. FOR HEALTHY LOA, F1 IS PERFECT. THE F1 SCORE SHOWS SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT TO HIGH-RISK LOANS.
OVERALL, THIS MODEL PERFORMS WELL.


## QUESTION: HOW WELL DOES THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL PREDICT BOTH THE 0 AND 1 LABELS?
## ANSWER: FOR THE HEALTHY LOAN, WE GET A 1.00 FOR PRECISION WHICH MEANS PERFECT. THE HIGH-RSIK LOAN IS JUST A LITTLE HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN THE LAST REPORT AT 0.87, AND THE F1 SCORE IS A VERYT HIGH 0.93.
THIS MODEL PERFORMS EXTREMELY WELL.
